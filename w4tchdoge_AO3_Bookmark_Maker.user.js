Script is out-of-the-box setup to automatically add title, author, status, summary, and last read date to the description in an "collapsible" section so as to not clutter the bookmark.

// @history        2.17.0 — (Pull request by PrincessGrouchy) Added/changed multiple `workInfo` variables. Changed `relationships` into 4 separate variants like fform_tags. Added `bkmrks_count` & `bkmrks_count_HTML` to indicate how many bookmarks a work/series has. Added `bookmark_type` to indicate whether it's a work or series bookmark. Added a workInfo variable for character tags with variants the same as for relationships and freeform tags.
// @history        2.16.3 — Fix the XPath for getting the button on the bottom nav actions bar that takes you to top of the page

// @history        2.16.0 — Add new workInfo variables for use on works that are a part of a series. Default workInfo has been changed to use these variables
// @history        2.15.0 — Add ability to include whether the work is a part of a series when Auto Tagging (defaults to off). Add new default workInfo variable `part_of_series` which is a string that shows what series a work is a part of and at what position of the series.

// @history        2.14.0 — Add option for AutoTag to include the fandom of the work/series when autotagging (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/291232); Add new variable `title_URL` which is just the URL of the work/series as plaintext (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/290711); Make the title of each work in `series_works_titles_summaries` a hyperlink to the work (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/290546); Add new work-only variable `series_link` which add information about any series' the work may be a part of (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/290546)

// @history        2.8.5 — Rename `series_works_summaries` to `series_works_titles_summaries` to indicate that it's functionality has been changed such that for series with more than 10 works it outputs just the title instead of the title and the summary, as the summaries for more than 10 works are unlikely to fit inside a bookmark

	/* EXPLANATION OF THE "CONSTANTS" THAT CAN BE CHANGED BY THE END USER

divider               : String which is used to indicate where the bookmark should be split in half


autoPrivate           : If true, automatically checks the checkbox to private the bookmark


autoRecommend         : If true, automatically checks the checkbox to mark the bookmark as a recommend


autoAutoTag           : If true, attempts to automatically run the Auto Tag function. Will NOT work if showAutoTagButton is false as it just automatically clicks the button provided by the showAutoTagButton


autoCollections       : A comma seperated list of names of collections you would like to add to the bookmark


includeFandom         : If true, include the fandom(s) of the work/series as user tags when running the Auto Tag function


showAutoTagButton     : If true, shows the "Auto Tag" button when bookmarking a work


seriesAutoTag         : If true, if the work is a part of a series adds the string "Series" to the user tags when running the Auto Tag function


bottomSummaryPage     : If true, checks if the current page is an entire work page or a work page that is not on the first chapter.
If the aforementioned checks are passed, Adds a "Summary Page" button to the bottom nav bar to easily navigate to a page where the summary exists so it can be picked up by the userscript.
This is done due to the fact that the last read date will not update when updating a bookmark from the latest chapter.


topSummaryPage        : If true, also adds a Summary Page button to the top nav bar next to the "Entire Work" button


simpleWorkSummary     : If true, uses the original method to retrieve the work summary (least hassle, but includes the 'Summary' heading element which some users may find annoying).
If false, retrieves the work summary in a way (which I call the fancy way) that allows more flexibility when customising newBookmarkNotes


FWS_asBlockquote      : If using the fancy work summary method, set whether you want to retrieve the summary as a blockquote.
For more information on the effects of changing simpleWorkSummary and FWS_asBlockquote, please look at where simpleWorkSummary is first used in the script, it should be around line 1697


AutoTag_type          : Determines how the AutoTag function works.
0 indicates it is using the original behaviour of the AutoTag function suggested by `oliver t` in https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/198028 that was present when AutoTag was first added to the userscript
1 indicates it is using the behaviour suggested by `prismbox` in https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/467885/discussions/255399 where canonical AO3 Wordcount tags are used for the word count tagging


splitSelect           : splitSelect changes which half of bookmarkNotes your initial bookmark is supposed to live in.
Valid values are 0 and 1.

e.g.
If you want the final bookmark (after pasting of autogenerated text) to look like the below text (and have configured it as such at the bottom of the script):

{bookmarkNotes}
<hr />
{title} by {author}<br />
{AO3_status}<br />
{summary}<br />

Then you can set divider = '<hr />' and splitSelect = 0
What this does is it replaces anything AFTER the <hr /> with the autogenerated bookmark text you've defined at the bottom while keeping your own text (e.g. "@ Chapter 2" or "Chapter 8 ripped my heart out").

If you instead want something like the following:

{title} by {author}<br />
{AO3_status}<br />
{summary}<br />
<hr />
{bookmarkNotes}

Then you can set divider = '<hr />' and splitSelect = 1, which replaces everything BEFORE your bookmark notes.

Another way to explain it is that the script works by taking the current contents of your bookmark and splitting it into two pieces along a user defined "divider", thus creating an array. Depending on the way you want the bookmark to be structured, the part of the bookmark that you want to keep could be before the divider or after the divider. splitSelect lets you tell the script which half of the array contains the bit of the bookmark you want to keep. If it's the first half splitSelect is 0, if it's the last half splitSelect is 1.
