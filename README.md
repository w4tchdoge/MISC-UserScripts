Collection of miscellaneous userscripts I've written OR scripts that other people have written that I have modified.

This repo is not meant for userscript distribution, it exists so that a PUSH webhook can be created to update any of the Greasy Fork hosted versions of the *userscripts I have written*. ***None*** of the scripts other people have written that I've put here are meant to be webhook'd, they exist here to mirror the folder setup on my machine.

Below is a list of the userscripts I've written that are mirrored on Greasy Fork via a webhook on this repo:
